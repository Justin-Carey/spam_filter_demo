# Naive Baysian Spam Filter

Implemented in Python, this filter utilizes Naive Baysian Probability to determine if an email is 'ham'(legit) or 'spam'. The model is trained on both ham and spam emails, so it knows the common words belonging to either. After training, new emails are classified as 'ham' or 'spam' based upon the words they contain.

For more info on the four sets of emails used, see the "data_set_info.txt" file in this repository.

This demo was created as a fun attempt to replicate the findings of [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220482991_An_Evaluation_of_Naive_Bayesian_Anti-Spam_Filtering).
